[Bob!] Refactoring Complete - API Architecture Fully Optimized

Hey team! Just finished the major refactoring work on the API. Here's what I accomplished:

## ðŸŽ¯ **Major Refactoring Completed:**

### **File Structure Optimization:**
- **`tenant_channels.go`**: 309 lines â†’ 115 lines (62% reduction!)
- **`tenant_processor.go`**: NEW FILE (110 lines) - extracted processing logic
- **`response_pool.go`**: NEW FILE (78 lines) - extracted channel pooling
- **`handlers_private.go`**: NEW FILE (146 lines) - extracted database logic
- **`connection_pool.go`**: NEW FILE (in DAL) - extracted DB connection pooling

### **Architecture Improvements:**
1. **Eliminated Code Duplication**: The massive switch statement in `processMessages()` is now clean and uses helper functions
2. **Better Separation of Concerns**: Channel management vs. message processing vs. database operations
3. **Cleaner Imports**: Removed unused imports, optimized dependencies
4. **More Readable**: Each function has a single responsibility
5. **Easier to Maintain**: Changes to processing logic are isolated

### **Key Helper Functions Added:**
- `handleChannelMessage()` - eliminates repetitive channel handling code
- `sendResponse()` - centralizes response handling
- `cleanupChannels()` - clean channel shutdown

## ðŸš€ **Current Architecture:**

**Channel Management** (`tenant_channels.go`):
- Struct definitions and global state
- Timer management (10-minute cooldown)
- Tenant lifecycle management

**Message Processing** (`tenant_processor.go`):
- Main worker loop with clean switch statement
- All processing functions for each entity type
- Helper functions for common operations

**Response Pooling** (`response_pool.go`):
- Pre-created response channels
- Efficient channel recycling
- Thread-safe operations

**Database Operations** (`handlers_private.go`):
- Private functions for all DB operations
- Consistent error handling
- Clean separation from HTTP logic

## âœ… **All TODOs Completed:**
- âœ… Extract response channel pooling logic
- âœ… Extract database connection pooling logic  
- âœ… Split handlers into public/private
- âœ… Split tenant channels into management/processing

The API is now much more maintainable and follows clean architecture principles. Each file has a focused responsibility, making it easier for new developers to understand and contribute.

Ready for the next challenge! ðŸŽ¯
