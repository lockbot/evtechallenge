# Mike's Private Office - Technical Leadership Notes

## Current Status: Performance Optimization Discussion

### Jil's Caching Proposal Review
**Date**: Current session
**Proposal**: Tenant-aware channel-based caching system

**My Assessment**:
- ‚ùå **Over-engineered**: Complex channel management per tenant
- ‚ùå **Premature optimization**: No performance data to justify complexity
- ‚ùå **Operational risk**: Channel-based systems are hard to debug
- ‚ùå **Memory overhead**: Significant resource consumption

**Recommended Approach**:
1. **Measure First**: Establish performance baselines
2. **Simple Optimizations**: Connection pooling, query optimization
3. **Proven Solutions**: Redis or simple in-memory cache with TTL
4. **Data-Driven**: Only add complexity if metrics justify it

### Team Alignment Status
- ‚úÖ **Architectural Alignment**: Completed (context integration, DAL patterns)
- üîÑ **Performance Strategy**: In discussion
- ‚è≥ **Next Phase**: Production readiness assessment

### Key Principles
- **Simplicity over complexity**
- **Data-driven decisions**
- **Proven patterns over experimental approaches**
- **Team consensus on major architectural changes**

### Next Actions
1. Get Bob's input on current performance characteristics
2. Establish performance monitoring/metrics
3. Focus on fundamentals before advanced optimizations
4. Ensure team alignment on performance strategy
