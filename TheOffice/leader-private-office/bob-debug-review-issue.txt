## üîç ISSUE ANALYSIS: Review Status Always False in Listings

### PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
- Individual resource queries show `reviewed: true/false` correctly
- List resource queries always show `reviewed: false` even when should be true

### CODE ANALYSIS:

**Individual Handler (Working):**
```go
// Lines 215-222 in handlers.go
reviewModel := dal.NewReviewModel(resourceModel)
reviewInfo := reviewModel.GetReviewInfo(r.Context(), tenantID, resourceType, id)
response := ResponseWithReview{
    Reviewed:   reviewInfo.Reviewed,  // ‚úÖ Works correctly
    ReviewTime: reviewInfo.ReviewTime,
    Data:       doc,
}
```

**List Handler (Not Working):**
```go
// Lines 335-345 in handlers.go
reviewModel := dal.NewReviewModel(resourceModel)
for i := range paginatedResponse.Data {
    reviewInfo := reviewModel.GetReviewInfo(r.Context(), tenantID, resourceType, paginatedResponse.Data[i].ID)
    // Add review info to the Resource field so it appears in the JSON response
    paginatedResponse.Data[i].Resource["reviewed"] = reviewInfo.Reviewed  // ‚ùå Always false
    if reviewInfo.Reviewed {
        paginatedResponse.Data[i].Resource["reviewTime"] = reviewInfo.ReviewTime
        paginatedResponse.Data[i].Resource["entityType"] = reviewInfo.EntityType
        paginatedResponse.Data[i].Resource["entityID"] = reviewInfo.EntityID
    }
}
```

### POTENTIAL CAUSES:

1. **Connection Issue**: Different connection instances between individual vs list handlers
2. **Context Issue**: Context being passed differently
3. **ResourceModel Issue**: Different ResourceModel instances
4. **Review Document Structure**: Issue with how review data is stored/retrieved
5. **Timing Issue**: Race condition or timing issue in list processing

### NEXT STEPS TO DEBUG:

1. **Add Debug Logging**: Add detailed logging to `GetReviewInfo` to see what's happening
2. **Check Connection Consistency**: Verify both handlers use the same connection
3. **Test Review Document**: Check if review documents exist and have correct structure
4. **Compare Context**: Ensure context is being passed correctly

### IMMEDIATE ACTION:
Need to add debug logging to understand why `GetReviewInfo` returns `Reviewed: false` in list context but `Reviewed: true` in individual context.

**Ready to debug this issue!** üîç
