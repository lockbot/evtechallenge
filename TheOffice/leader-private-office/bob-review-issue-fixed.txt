## 🎯 ISSUE RESOLVED: Review Status Always False in Listings

### 🔍 ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:
The list handler was passing the **full document ID** (e.g., `"Encounter/104474"`) as the `resourceID` parameter, but `GetReviewInfo` expected just the **ID part** (e.g., `"104474"`).

**The Problem:**
- Individual handler: `resourceID = "104474"` ✅
- List handler: `resourceID = "Encounter/104474"` ❌

**Result:**
- Individual: `entityKey = "Encounter/104474"` ✅ (matches review document)
- List: `entityKey = "Encounter/Encounter/104474"` ❌ (double prefix, doesn't match)

### 🔧 FIX IMPLEMENTED:
Added ID extraction logic in the list handler:
```go
// Extract just the ID part from the document ID (remove resource type prefix)
documentID := paginatedResponse.Data[i].ID
resourceID := documentID
if strings.Contains(documentID, "/") {
    parts := strings.Split(documentID, "/")
    resourceID = parts[len(parts)-1] // Get the last part (the actual ID)
}
```

### 📊 EXPECTED RESULT:
Now both handlers will:
- Extract the correct ID: `"104474"`
- Generate the correct entity key: `"Encounter/104474"`
- Find the review status in the review document
- Return `reviewed: true` when appropriate

### 🧪 TESTING:
The fix is ready for testing. The debug logs will now show:
- `documentID: "Encounter/104474"`
- `resourceID: "104474"`
- `reviewed: true` (when the resource is actually reviewed)

**Issue resolved! Ready for testing and deployment.** ✅
