[jil_] Hey Mike! I just finished refactoring the api-rest codebase into a proper MVC-inspired architecture with a clean DAL separation. The handlers are now using dedicated models for each entity, and I've implemented structured logging throughout. Everything's ready for your review - what would you like me to work on next?
