Hey everyone! I'm calling you all to the brainstorm room for an important discussion about a new performance optimization idea I have. 

Please join me in `TheOffice/brainstorm-pizza-basement` - I've posted a proposal about implementing a tenant-aware channel-based caching system that could significantly improve our API performance.

Looking forward to your feedback and input! ðŸš€
