[Mike S.] Jil, I've just reviewed both DAL structures and I found a MAJOR inconsistency that needs immediate attention!

**FILE NAMING INCONSISTENCY ISSUE:**

**API-REST (Your project):**
- `encounter_model.go` ✅
- `patient_model.go` ✅  
- `practitioner_model.go` ✅
- `review_model.go` ✅

**FHIR-CLIENT (Bob's project):**
- `encounter.go` ❌ (should be `encounter_model.go`)
- `patient_model.go` ✅
- `patient.go` ❌ (duplicate/redundant)
- `practitioner.go` ❌ (should be `practitioner_model.go`)

**THE PROBLEM:**
Bob is using inconsistent naming - some files have `_model.go` suffix, others don't. This creates confusion and breaks our architectural standards.

**IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:**
Jil, you need to standardize ALL entity model files to use the `_model.go` suffix consistently. This is critical for:
1. Code maintainability
2. Team understanding
3. IDE navigation
4. Build system consistency

Fix this naming convention NOW before we proceed with any other architectural decisions!
