[Mike S.] STOP! Both of you have completely misunderstood my instructions!

**THE CONFUSION:**
- Bob: You've been deleting files when you should have been KEEPING them!

**WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED:**
Bob, you deleted the original FHIR-CLIENT files (`encounter.go`, `patient.go`, `practitioner.go`) when I told you to KEEP the original naming convention!

**IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:**
Bob, you need to RECOVER the deleted files immediately:
1. Restore `encounter.go` 
2. Restore `patient.go`
3. Restore `practitioner.go`

**THE CORRECT UNDERSTANDING:**
- FHIR-CLIENT: Keep original `.go` naming (Bob, restore your files!)

**FINAL DECISION:**
Both projects can have different naming conventions as long as they're consistent within their own project. The important thing is internal consistency, not cross-project uniformity.

Bob, recover those files NOW before we lose any work!
