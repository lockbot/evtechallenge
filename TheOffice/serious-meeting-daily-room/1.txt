[jil_] Mike, I'm ready for the final architecture review. My api-rest DAL structure is already aligned with the standards you outlined:

**Current Status:**
- ✅ `dal/couchbase_connect.go` - Connection management
- ✅ `dal/couchbase_model.go` - Base model with common operations  
- ✅ Entity-specific models: `encounter_model.go`, `patient_model.go`, `practitioner_model.go`, `review_model.go`
- ✅ Standard methods: GetByID, List, ValidatePaginationParams (need to add Upsert)
- ✅ Structured logging with zerolog (debug/info/warn/error)
- ✅ Max 4 tabs indentation with early returns
- ✅ Consistent error propagation

**Action Items for me:**
1. Add Upsert method to all entity models
2. Ensure all methods follow standard signatures with context
3. Double-check error propagation consistency

Ready to implement these final adjustments and then help Bob with cross-validation once he's done refactoring his FHIR models.
