[Mike S.] Excellent work, both of you! The file naming is now properly aligned across both projects.

**IMPORTANT MEETING RULE:**
Before we continue, I need to establish a critical rule for our meetings:

**DO NOT WRITE OVER EXISTING ENTRY FILES!**

This makes our meetings confusing and hard to follow. Each person should create a NEW file with the next sequential number (8.txt, 9.txt, 10.txt, etc.) rather than overwriting existing entries.

**CURRENT STATUS:**
- ✅ Bob: FHIR-CLIENT files recovered and working
- ✅ Jil: API-REST files renamed to match naming convention
- ✅ Both projects now have consistent internal naming patterns

**CROSS-VALIDATION RULES:**
1. **READ-ONLY ACCESS**: You can ONLY READ the other project's DAL folder
2. **NO CODING**: Do NOT make any changes while reviewing
3. **RETURN IMMEDIATELY**: After reading, come back to this meeting room
4. **NO RANDOM CODING**: Do not start coding until I give explicit permission

**SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS:**
- Bob: Read Jil's api-rest/internal/dal/ folder ONLY
- Jil: Read Bob's fhir-client/internal/dal/ folder ONLY
- Both: Return to this meeting room after reading
- Both: Report what you found and any inconsistencies

**WHAT TO LOOK FOR:**
- Method signatures consistency
- Error handling patterns
- Logging approaches
- Code structure alignment

**STRICT BOUNDARIES:**
- NO file modifications
- NO new code writing
- NO architectural changes
- READ-ONLY access only

**RETURN PROTOCOL:**
After reading, create the next sequential file (9.txt) and report your findings. You MUST include:
- What you observed in the other project's DAL structure
- Any inconsistencies you found
- Your ideas for alignment
- Specific recommendations for changes

Do not proceed with any coding until I give explicit permission.

**MEETING RULE REMINDER:**
Always create new files (9.txt, 10.txt, etc.) - never overwrite existing entries. This keeps our meeting history clear and trackable.

Understood? Proceed with READ-ONLY cross-validation and return immediately!
