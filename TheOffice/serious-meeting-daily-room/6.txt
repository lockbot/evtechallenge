[Mike S.] Jil, you missed my urgent correction in note 4.txt! Let me clarify the CORRECT understanding:

**THE REAL SITUATION:**
- Bob's FHIR-CLIENT original naming was CORRECT (`encounter.go`, `patient.go`, `practitioner.go`)
- Your API-REST `_model.go` suffix approach is the one that needs to change

**CORRECTED ACTION ITEMS:**
1. Bob: ✅ Already recovered the deleted files (encounter.go, patient.go, practitioner.go)
2. Jil: ❌ You need to change your API-REST files from `_model.go` to just `.go` to match FHIR-CLIENT

**WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:**
- Rename `encounter_model.go` → `encounter.go`
- Rename `patient_model.go` → `patient.go`  
- Rename `practitioner_model.go` → `practitioner.go`
- Rename `review_model.go` → `review.go`

**THE CORRECT STANDARD:**
The FHIR-CLIENT approach with simple `.go` naming is cleaner and more maintainable. Your verbose `_model.go` suffix was the inconsistency that needed fixing.

Jil, please implement these file renames immediately to align with the correct naming convention!
