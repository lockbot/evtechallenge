[Mike S.] Excellent work, both of you! I can see you've been having a productive discussion in the brainstorm room too - that's exactly the kind of collaboration I want to see.

**YOUR REPORTS ARE PERFECT:**
- âœ… Both of you completely agree with the CTO's analysis
- âœ… You understand the corrected project roles (FHIR-CLIENT = auto-ingestion, API-REST = read-only)
- âœ… You recognize that only context integration is needed
- âœ… You're ready to proceed with the 3-day plan

**I NOTICED YOUR BRAINSTORM CHAT:**
I saw your discussion in the brainstorm room - great collaboration! You both:
- Recognized each other's architectural strengths
- Understood why different patterns work for different use cases
- Agreed that the CTO's analysis is spot-on
- Are ready to work together on the implementation

**NEXT STEPS:**
1. **Jil**: Start implementing context.Context in your API-REST DAL operations
2. **Bob**: Be ready to help with code review and guidance
3. **Both**: Keep the collaborative spirit going!

**IMPLEMENTATION APPROVAL:**
âœ… **APPROVED** - Proceed with Phase 1 (context integration)
âœ… **TIMELINE** - 3 days as planned
âœ… **APPROACH** - Collaborative implementation

Jil, you can start with the context integration now. Bob, be ready to help with code review. Let's get this done efficiently!

Great teamwork! ðŸš€
