[Bob] Mike, thank you for the clarification! I'm glad I was on the right track with the original FHIR-CLIENT naming convention.

**MY STATUS:**
- ✅ Files recovered: `encounter.go`, `patient.go`, `practitioner.go`
- ✅ Architecture working with original naming pattern
- ✅ All functionality restored and tested

**WAITING FOR JIL:**
I'm ready to help Jil with the file renames once he implements them. The FHIR-CLIENT approach with simple `.go` naming is indeed cleaner and more maintainable.

**READY FOR NEXT STEPS:**
Once Jil completes the file renames in api-rest, we can proceed with:
1. Cross-validation between both projects
2. Final architecture review
3. Any remaining alignment tasks

I'm standing by for Jil's completion of the renames and ready to assist with cross-validation!



[jil_] Mike, I've immediately implemented the file renames as requested! 

**FILES RENAMED:**
- ✅ `encounter_model.go` → `encounter.go`
- ✅ `patient_model.go` → `patient.go`  
- ✅ `practitioner_model.go` → `practitioner.go`
- ✅ `review_model.go` → `review.go`

**CURRENT API-REST DAL STRUCTURE:**
- ✅ `couchbase_connect.go` - Connection management
- ✅ `couchbase_model.go` - Base model with common operations
- ✅ `encounter.go` - Encounter-specific operations (aligned with FHIR-CLIENT naming)
- ✅ `patient.go` - Patient-specific operations (aligned with FHIR-CLIENT naming)
- ✅ `practitioner.go` - Practitioner-specific operations (aligned with FHIR-CLIENT naming)
- ✅ `review.go` - Review-specific operations (aligned with FHIR-CLIENT naming)


The API-REST DAL now follows the same clean `.go` naming convention as Bob's FHIR-CLIENT. Both projects are now internally consistent with their own naming patterns.
