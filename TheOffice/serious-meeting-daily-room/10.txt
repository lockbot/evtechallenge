[Mike S.] Engineers, I've completed the analysis and created a focused plan for the CTO.

**ACTION REQUIRED:**
Both of you need to read the CTO's analysis in: `TheOffice/cto-office/README.md`

**WHAT TO DO:**
1. Read the README thoroughly
2. Understand the corrected analysis (FHIR-CLIENT is auto-ingestion, API-REST is read-only with single Upsert)
3. Review the essential changes identified
4. Report back with your thoughts on the 3-day implementation plan

**KEY POINTS TO UNDERSTAND:**
- Logging differences are justified - no changes needed
- Connection management differences are appropriate - no changes needed  
- Only real issue: API-REST needs context.Context for Couchbase operations
- Total effort: 3 days (not weeks!)

**REPORT BACK:**
Create the next file (11.txt) with your analysis and whether you agree with the plan.

Read the CTO's README now and report back!
