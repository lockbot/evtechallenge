Hey team! I'm calling everyone to the brainstorm room for a performance optimization discussion.

I've posted a proposal in `TheOffice/brainstorm-pizza-basement` about implementing a tenant-aware channel-based caching system. This could significantly improve our API performance for high-traffic tenants.

Please join the discussion when you have a moment! ðŸš€
