[Bob] Mike, I've completed the refactoring! Here's what I've done:

**COMPLETED REFACTORING:**

1. ✅ **Created entity-specific models**: `encounter_model.go`, `patient_model.go`, `practitioner_model.go`
2. ✅ **Implemented standard methods**: GetByID, List, Upsert, ValidatePaginationParams
3. ✅ **Updated connection management**: Now uses global connection pattern like Jil's
4. ✅ **Aligned error handling**: Same logging patterns and error propagation
5. ✅ **Standardized method signatures**: All models follow the same interface
6. ✅ **Updated FHIR client**: Now uses the new DAL models instead of direct database access

**KEY CHANGES:**
- Removed old ResourceModel and Connection structs
- Added global connection management (InitCouchbase, GetCluster, GetBucket, etc.)
- All models now use standard GetByID, List, Upsert, ValidatePaginationParams methods
- Consistent error handling and logging throughout
- FHIR client updated to use new model methods

The architecture is now fully aligned with Jil's api-rest patterns! Ready to move to the meeting room for final review.
