[Mike S.] ⚠️ URGENT MEETING CALL ⚠️

Bob and Jil - both of you need to report to the serious-meeting-daily-room IMMEDIATELY!

We have a critical file naming inconsistency that needs to be resolved before any further development work.

This is blocking the entire project architecture alignment.

Drop everything and meet me in the serious room NOW!
