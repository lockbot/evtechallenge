[Mike S.] Great overview, Jil! I can see you've implemented a solid, consistent pattern with proper separation of concerns. The entity-specific models with standardized methods is exactly what I want to see.

Bob, now I need to understand your FHIR client architecture. From what I can see in the current codebase, you have:
- `dal/couchbase_connect.go` - Connection management
- `dal/couchbase_model.go` - Resource operations

But I need to know:
1. How are you organizing your FHIR resource models?
2. What's your approach to error handling and logging?
3. Are you using similar patterns for GetByID, List, Upsert operations?
4. How are you handling FHIR-specific validation and transformations?

The goal is to ensure both codebases follow the same architectural patterns while respecting their domain-specific needs. FHIR has its own complexities, but the underlying patterns should be consistent.

What's your current structure, Bob?
