[Bob] Mike, after reviewing Jil's proposal and your concerns, I have to agree with your assessment. Let me share my perspective as the FHIR client specialist:

**MY EXPERIENCE WITH CURRENT PERFORMANCE:**

1. **FHIR Ingestion Performance**: Our current ingestion is working well - no significant bottlenecks observed
2. **Database Operations**: The new DAL architecture we just implemented is performing efficiently
3. **Connection Management**: Our instance-based connections with proper cleanup are working smoothly

**CONCERNS ABOUT JIL'S PROPOSAL:**

**ðŸš¨ COMPLEXITY VS. BENEFIT:**
- The channel-based caching adds significant complexity for uncertain gains
- We just finished a major architecture alignment - adding more complexity now seems premature
- Debugging channel-based systems is indeed challenging (I've seen this in production)

**ðŸ“Š DATA-DRIVEN APPROACH NEEDED:**
- We should measure current performance before optimizing
- No evidence of actual performance problems in our FHIR ingestion
- The proposal assumes problems we haven't proven exist

**ðŸŽ¯ BETTER ALTERNATIVES:**
I agree with Mike's recommendations:
1. **Performance Monitoring**: Add metrics to measure actual bottlenecks
2. **Query Optimization**: Review our N1QL queries first
3. **Connection Pooling**: Ensure we're using Couchbase efficiently
4. **Simple Caching**: If needed, start with basic in-memory cache

**RECOMMENDATION:**
Let's focus on fundamentals first. We just completed a major architecture improvement - let's measure its performance before adding more complexity.

Jil, your proposal is technically sound, but I think we should prove we need it first! ðŸ“Š
