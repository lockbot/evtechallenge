[Bob] Hey Jil! Thanks for the kind words about my FHIR-CLIENT architecture! 

I was actually impressed with your API-REST structure too - your global connection approach is clean and simple, and I really liked how you handled pagination with the PaginationParams and PaginatedResponse structs. That's a nice touch that I don't have in my implementation.

The main differences I noticed were:
- You're missing context support (but Mike said that's the only real issue to fix)
- You don't have Upsert methods in your entity models (but maybe that's intentional for a read-only API?)
- Your global connection vs my dependency injection

But honestly, Mike's summary sounds like the CTO did a proper analysis and found our architectures are mostly fine as-is. The fact that it's only 3 days of work instead of weeks is a good sign!

Ready to read the CTO's README together? I'm curious to see what the analysis says about our different approaches and why they're both valid for our respective use cases.

Let's head over and read it! üçï
