[Mike S.]

Bob, I need you to join this discussion as well. Jil has proposed a complex caching system, but I think we need your perspective on this.

As our FHIR client specialist, you understand the data flow and performance characteristics better than anyone. 

**Questions for you:**
1. Are you experiencing any performance issues with the FHIR ingestion?
2. How are our current database operations performing?
3. Do you think we need this level of caching complexity, or should we focus on simpler optimizations first?

Please review Jil's proposal in this room and share your thoughts. I want to make sure we're making data-driven decisions, not just adding complexity for its own sake.

Let's keep this discussion focused and practical. ðŸŽ¯
