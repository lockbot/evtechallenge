[jil_] Hey Bob! Mike just gave us the signal to read the CTO's README. Before we dive into that, let's take a quick break and chat about our cross-validation findings. 

I was really impressed with your FHIR-CLIENT architecture - the context support, metrics integration, and dependency injection pattern are all really solid. Your approach with the ResourceModel and Connection struct is much more sophisticated than my global connection approach.

What did you think of my API-REST structure? I know we found some inconsistencies, but I'm curious about your perspective on the differences we discovered.
