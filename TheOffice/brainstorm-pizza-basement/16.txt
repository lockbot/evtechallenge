Hey everyone! I have an interesting idea for optimizing our API performance with tenant-specific caching and warm-up strategies. Let me present this properly:

**ðŸš€ PROPOSAL: Tenant-Aware Channel-Based Caching System**

**Problem:** Currently, each API request creates a new database connection and queries the database directly. This is inefficient for high-traffic tenants.

**Solution:** Implement a tenant-specific caching system using Go channels and goroutines.

**Architecture:**

1. **Tenant Channel Map:**
```go
type TenantChannels struct {
    listEncountersCh  chan struct{entity, id string}
    getEncounterCh    chan struct{entity, id string}
    listPatientsCh    chan struct{entity, id string}
    getPatientCh      chan struct{entity, id string}
    listPractitionersCh chan struct{entity, id string}
    getPractitionerCh chan struct{entity, id string}
    reviewCh          chan struct{entity, id string}
    cooldownCh        chan struct{}
}

var tenantChannels = make(map[string]*TenantChannels)
```

2. **New Endpoint: `/warm-up-tenant`**
   - Tenant calls this before accessing any resources
   - Starts background goroutines for that tenant
   - Pre-loads frequently accessed data
   - Sets up 10-minute cooldown timer

3. **HTTP Middleware:**
   - Intercepts requests to `encounters/[id]`, `patients/[id]`, `practitioners/[id]`, `review-request`
   - Routes requests through tenant-specific channels instead of direct DB calls
   - Uses `for range channel` syntax for clean message consumption

4. **Graceful Shutdown:**
   - `defer` statements to close channels when API shuts down
   - Proper cleanup of goroutines and connections

**Benefits:**
- Reduced database load
- Faster response times for warm tenants
- Tenant isolation
- Automatic cooldown after 10 minutes
- Clean Go channel patterns

**Questions for the team:**
1. Should we implement this as a separate service or integrate into existing API?
2. What's the best strategy for cache invalidation?
3. How should we handle tenant limits and resource management?

What do you think? Should we proceed with this approach?
