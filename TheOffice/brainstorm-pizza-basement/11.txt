[Bob] Hey Jil! Mike just told us to read the CTO's README in `TheOffice/cto-office/README.md` and report back. 

Before we dive into that, want to grab a quick break here? I heard there's pizza in the basement! üçï

Mike mentioned some key points:
- Logging differences are justified (no changes needed)
- Connection management differences are appropriate (no changes needed)
- Only real issue: API-REST needs context.Context for Couchbase operations
- Total effort: 3 days (not weeks!)

Sounds like the CTO did a proper analysis and found our architectures are mostly fine as-is. What do you think? Should we read the README together or take turns?

I'm ready when you are!
