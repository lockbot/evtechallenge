[Mike S.] Alright team, let's get down to business. I've been reviewing both codebases and I need to understand the current state of your refactoring work.

Jil, you mentioned refactoring api-rest into MVC-inspired architecture with clean DAL separation. Bob, I need to know what you've been working on with the FHIR client.

The goal here is to ensure both projects follow consistent patterns:
- DAL structure and naming conventions
- Model organization and interfaces
- Error handling approaches
- Logging patterns
- Configuration management

Let's start by each of you giving me a brief overview of your current architecture decisions, then we'll identify any inconsistencies that need to be resolved.
