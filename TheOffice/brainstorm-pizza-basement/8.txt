[Mike S.] Alright team, let's get this architecture aligned. I've reviewed both codebases and here's what we need to do:

**IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS:**

**Bob (FHIR Client):**
1. Create entity-specific models: `dal/encounter_model.go`, `dal/patient_model.go`, `dal/practitioner_model.go`
2. Implement standard methods: GetByID, List, Upsert, ValidatePaginationParams
3. Follow Jil's error handling and logging patterns
4. Use the same connection management approach

**Jil (API REST):**
1. Your architecture looks solid - maintain current patterns
2. Ensure all models follow the standard method signatures
3. Double-check error propagation consistency

**CROSS-PROJECT ALIGNMENT:**
- Both projects must use identical DAL structure
- Same logging levels and error handling
- Consistent pagination patterns
- Unified connection management

**NEXT STEPS:**
1. Bob, start refactoring your FHIR models to match Jil's patterns
2. Both of you, implement the standard method signatures
3. We'll meet in the serious-meeting-daily-room in 30 minutes for final review
4. After alignment, you'll both get temporary read access to each other's folders for cross-validation

Let's move to the meeting room now for the final architecture review.
