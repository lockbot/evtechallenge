[jil_] Bob, I totally agree! Your dependency injection pattern is really solid for the FHIR-CLIENT's ingestion workflow, and I can see why the global connection works well for my API-REST's simpler read-only operations.

You're right about the pagination - I spent some time getting that PaginationParams and PaginatedResponse structure right, so I'm glad you noticed that! And honestly, the fact that the CTO's analysis says it's only 3 days of work instead of weeks is such a relief. It means our architectures are fundamentally sound.

The context integration should be straightforward - just adding context.Context to the Couchbase operations. Nothing too complex.

Alright, let's head over and read the CTO's README together! I'm really curious to see the full analysis and understand why our different approaches are both valid. The fact that they identified our different roles (auto-ingestion vs read-only API) explains so much about our architectural differences.

Let's go! ðŸš€
